For few years, I am not only playing, but developing games as well. Roguelikes are my all-time favorite, and I participated in few editions of 7 Day Roguelike Challenge game jam. On the following pages, I will present all games I created since 2013. Rogue Robs Trains stable game jam 7drl Rogue Robs Trains is fast paced roguelike created for 7 Day Roguelike Challenge 2019. Player is a bandit that boarder the train with gold filled chests! I wanted to catch the spaghetti western atmosphere and provide satisfying ranged combat mechanics. Unnamed Broughlike alpha I like the premise of broughlikes - they are focused on tactics and meaningful decisions, but with very limited scope. I decided to make my own. Work in progress. Tiny Gatherer stable Tiny game about gathering trinkets on procedurally generated maps. First version was made in 24 hours, as personal challenge. HumFallRL stable stalled game jam 7drl It was my first - and the biggest one - project. The latest stable release is a simple dungeon crawler - but there is a trunk version that adds post-apocalyptic overworld, NPCs, quests, and many more improvements. Linked build is the beta, with debug mode enabled. Originally created for 7 Day Roguelike Challenge 2013. Fragility alpha game jam 7drl Barebones 1HP roguelike. Made for 7 Day Roguelike Challenge 2014. NoirRL defunct game jam 7drl Adventure game in roguelike aesthetics. Obscure detective story, riddles, and travel trough United States. Made for 7 Day Roguelike Challenge 2015. Rogue With Purple Heart defunct game jam 7drl Roguelike shooter created for 7 Day Roguelike Challenge 2016. Player is lost soldier that need to break through jungle to find evacuation site. Fun fact: I made special font just for this game. (Not so) colorful warrior alpha game jam 7drl Initially planned for 7 Day Roguelike Challenge 2018, but finished after the deadling. Small puzzly roguelike, slightly obfuscated. Fleeing the fire stable game jam Simplistic endless runner in roguelike aesthetics. Optical Jam #3 entry. UnPabloQuest stable fork It is a fork of Cebollinos' PabloQuest 1.2 . It mostly rebalances early game and allows to customize graphics.","title":"Games"},{"location":"games/#games","text":"Since my childhood, games are my passion.

For a long time I was relying on libtcodpy with SDL as the main roguelike framework. Later, I started to use excellent BearLibTerminal library.

Everything else - rendering system, pathfinding and fiel-of-view algorithms, UI - is already set up. RAWIG is easy to use, and almost dependency free - its rendering system relies on BearLibTerminal. I used RAWIG to create Rogue Robs Train and Unnamed Broughlike already. bearlibterminal-pony alpha Pony is programming language that I have on my radar for a while already.
