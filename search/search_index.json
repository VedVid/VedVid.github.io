For few years, I am not only playing games - I develop them as well. Roguelikes are my all-time favorite, and I participated in many editions of 7 Day Roguelike Challenge game jam. Below, I will present you all games I created since 2013. Rogue Robs Trains stable game jam 7drl Rogue Robs Trains is fast paced roguelike created for 7 Day Roguelike Challenge 2019. Player is a bandit that boarded the train to get his hands on gold filled chests! I wanted to catch the spaghetti western atmosphere and provide satisfying ranged combat mechanics. It is the first game created with RAWIG, and I hope not the last one - it worked very well and sped up the development process significantly. I had to adapt framework for different needs, but most of changes made specifically for Rogue Robs Trains has been implemented into RAWIG later. Unnamed Broughlike alpha It is my most recent game-related project. I was reading about broughlikes recently. It is very specific genre, related to roguelikes, but everything started with Michael Brough . Linked wikipedia article provides rough overview of design goals of broughlikes. Unfortunately, I do not have access to iOS devices, but I read a lot about Brough's games. I have to say, I like their premise: small scale and streamlined gameplay, yet every run is full of meaningful decisions. My take on broughlikes is still in early stage of development, but I had already a lot of fun with designing basic mechanics. I want to make resources management the core of the game, yet keep it simple. Player - pilot of mecha - can shoot foes from afar, but every enemy is vulnerable to only one type of damage. Launchers' magazines are short, therefore player need to replenish ammo often. The catch? Every drained resource should raise risk level , for example by spawning new enemy. Tiny Gatherer stable Tiny game about gathering trinkets on procedurally generated maps. First version was made in 24 hours, as personal challenge. HumFallRL stable stalled game jam 7drl It was my first serious project. The latest stable release is a simple dungeon crawler - but there is a trunk version that adds post-apocalyptic overworld, NPCs, quests, and many more improvements. Linked build is beta, with debug mode enabled. Originally created for 7 Day Roguelike Challenge 2013. Fragility alpha game jam 7drl Barebones 1HP roguelike. Made for 7 Day Roguelike Challenge 2014. NoirRL defunct game jam 7drl Adventure game in roguelike aesthetics. Obscure detective story, broken riddles, and travel trough United States. Made for 7 Day Roguelike Challenge 2015. Rogue With Purple Heart defunct game jam 7drl Roguelike shooter created for 7 Day Roguelike Challenge 2016. Player is lost soldier that need to break through jungle to find evacuation site. Fun fact: I made special font just for this game. (Not so) colorful warrior alpha game jam 7drl Initially planned for 7 Day Roguelike Challenge 2018, but finished after the deadline. Small puzzle roguelike, with slightly obfuscated set of rules. Fleeing the fire stable game jam Simplistic endless runner in roguelike aesthetics. Optical Jam #3 entry. UnPabloQuest stable fork It is a fork of Cebollinos' PabloQuest 1.2 . UPQ rebalances early game and allows to customize graphics.","title":"Games"},{"location":"games/#games","text":"Since my childhood, games have been my passion.
