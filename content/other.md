# cyrillic2polish

Most of the available tools transcripts Cyrillic script to latin alphabed using English forms. Even in the Polish media you see English-based transcriptions all the time. It motivated me to write a simple tool to transcript and transliterate Cyrillic to Latin alphabet, using simplified PN-ISO standard. Written in Python.

# bearlibterminal-pony

I had Pony programming language on my radar for a while already. It seems to provide nice guarantees without much burden, and has easy to use C FFI. Therefore, creating a simple wrapper for BearLibTerminal looks like a nice way to learn a bit more about Pony.
