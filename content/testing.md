Since July 2023, I work as a game tester in [BoomBit](https://boombit.com).

During the past years, I tested:
- a couple dozens of mobile games, from hypercasuals to midcores
- playable ads, websites, web apps, console games

and learned how to:
- work with various teams, using different methodologies
- perform a variety of tests types:
    - full tests, focus tests, maintenance tests, regression tests, smoke tests, performance tests, compliance tests, exploratory tests.

I use a wide array of technologies :
- Jira, Redmine, Testmo, Notion
- Android, iOS, web
- Iron Source, AppLovin, AppsFlyer, adb, Firebase

Currently learning:
- testing automation with Playwright

Thanks to the previous experience in sales and technical support,  
the communication with both: clients and developer teams is one of my strengths.

In my spare time, I develop small [games](/games), and sometimes I create a test suite for them as well.  
Please see [Fantasy Game Creation Kit](/games#fantasy-game-creation-kit) for example.
